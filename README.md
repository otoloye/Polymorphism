# Polymorphism
This app demonstrates and explains the concept of polymorphism in the simplest way you can understand using JAVA programming language.

Polymorphism refers to a principle in biology in which an organism or species can have many different forms or stages. This principle can also be applied to object-oriented programming and languages like the Java language. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.
